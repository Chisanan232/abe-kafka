# Requirements

Before using abe-kafka or contributing to this repository, ensure your environment meets the following requirements.

## System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, or Windows
- **Memory**: Minimum 1GB RAM (2GB+ recommended for development)
- **Disk Space**: Minimum 1GB for full development environment
- **Internet Connection**: Required for downloading dependencies and testing with external queue services

## Core Prerequisites

### Python

- Versions supported: 3.12, 3.13

:::tip Python Installation
If you don't have Python installed:
- **macOS**: Use `brew install python` or download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/)
- **Linux**: Use your package manager (e.g., `apt install python3.13`)
- **Windows**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) or use `winget install Python.Python.3.13`
:::

### Package Manager: uv (Recommended)

This project uses **[uv]** for fast, reproducible Python environments.

**Installation:**
```bash
# macOS and Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# Alternative: via pip
pip install uv
```

**Why uv?**
- ⚡ **10-100x faster** than pip/poetry for dependency resolution
- 🔒 **Deterministic builds** with lockfile support  
- 🛠️ **All-in-one tool** for project management, virtual environments, and Python installation
- 📦 **Drop-in replacement** for pip with better dependency resolution

### Version Control

- **Git**: Version 2.20 or higher

## Kafka & optional tools

- Kafka broker: Not required for unit tests. Needed for real-cluster integration tests.
- Docker: Optional. Used by Testcontainers-based integration test to spin up Kafka locally.
- Node.js + pnpm: Optional. Only needed to build the documentation site.

## Python Dependencies

Installed automatically by `pip install abe-kafka` or `uv sync`:

- `abstract-backend>=0.0.1`
- `kafka-python>=2.0,<3`

## Verify your setup

After installing the prerequisites, verify your setup:

```bash
# Check Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.12 or 3.13

# Check uv installation
uv --version  # Should show uv version

# Check Git
git --version  # Should be 2.20+

# Sync dependencies (optional if using pip install)
uv sync

### For contributors

If you plan to develop or run tests, see:

- Development requirements: ../../development/requirements.mdx
- Workflow and running tests: ../../development/workflow.mdx
```

## Next Steps

Once your environment meets these requirements, you're ready to:

1. 📋 **[Install the template](./installation)** - Clone and set up your plugin project
2. 🔧 **[Implement your backend](./how-to-run)** - Build your message queue logic
3. 🧪 **Test your service** - Validate integration with your application
4. 🚀 **Publish your package** - Share with the community

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Python Version Issues
```bash
# If you have multiple Python versions
uv python install 3.13
uv python pin 3.13
```

### uv Installation Issues
```bash
# If uv command not found after installation
source ~/.bashrc  # or restart terminal
```

### Permission Issues
```bash
# If you get permission errors
uv venv --system-site-packages
```
