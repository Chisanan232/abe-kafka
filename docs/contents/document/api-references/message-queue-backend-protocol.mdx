# MessageQueueBackend Protocol

The `MessageQueueBackend` protocol is the standard interface used by Abstract Backend to communicate with message queues.

abe-kafka implements this protocol using kafka-python so you can install, configure, and use Kafka without dealing with implementation details.

## What you need to know (user-facing)

- Configure abe-kafka via environment variables. See the tables in:
  - Introduction → Configuration (env vars)
  - API References → Kafka Backend
- Use `publish(key, payload)` where `key` is the topic and `payload` is JSON-serialisable.
- Use `consume(group=...)` to read JSON messages; group IDs are prefixed automatically.
