# Kafka Message Queue Backend - Extending abstract-backend with Kafka Support

<!-- truncate -->

As a developer working with component-based architectures, I recognized a familiar need: adding a robust Kafka backend to systems that discover and load components at runtime via entry points (like abstract-backend).

abe-kafka exists to provide a production-ready Kafka integration that you can plug into any compatible system with minimal configuration.

## The Problem: Limited Backend Options

Many projects rely on a generic message queue interface but only ship one or two concrete implementations. Teams who need Kafka end up writing custom glue code repeatedly — or compromising on features and operability.

## The Solution: Universal Kafka Backend Component

abe-kafka implements a Kafka backend that:

- Aligns with the MessageQueueBackend protocol used by abstract-backend style systems.
- Loads via entry points so it can be discovered dynamically at runtime.
- Supports PLAINTEXT, SASL/PLAIN, and SSL out of the box.
- Uses JSON serialization for straightforward publish/consume flows.

## Built for Component-Based Architectures

If your application selects components by name (e.g., `MESSAGE_QUEUE_BACKEND=kafka`), abe-kafka slots in without invasive changes. Configuration is environment-first, making it a good fit for containers and CI/CD pipelines.

## Real Impact: Extending Backend Capabilities

- Before: Teams wrote one-off Kafka integrations, with inconsistent configuration and testing approaches.
- After: A reusable, tested Kafka backend that standardizes configuration and behavior across projects.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install (choose one)
pip install abe-kafka
# or
uv add abe-kafka

# Minimal environment
export MESSAGE_QUEUE_BACKEND=kafka
export KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=localhost:9092
```

```python
import asyncio
from abe_plugin.backends.message_queue.service.abe_kafka import KafkaMessageQueueBackend

async def main():
    backend = KafkaMessageQueueBackend.from_env()
    await backend.publish("demo-topic", {"hello": "world"})
    async for msg in backend.consume(group="g1"):
        print("received:", msg)
        break
    await backend.close()

asyncio.run(main())
```

See the Installation and How to Run guides in the docs for SASL/SSL examples and local Kafka options (Docker Compose or Testcontainers).

## Project Goals

- Provide a first-class Kafka backend that is easy to adopt.
- Keep configuration simple and environment-driven.
- Ensure reliability with integration tests and practical examples.

## The Journey Continues

Feedback and contributions are welcome. If you use abstract-backend style architectures and want rock-solid Kafka support, give abe-kafka a try!
